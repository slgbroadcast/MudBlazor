# MudBlazor Roadmap

MudBlazor continues to thrive with millions of downloads on [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/MudBlazor/) and thousands of members on [Discord](https://discord.gg/mudblazor).

With the recent release of v7, and now v8, we've made significant progress in ensuring the library remains healthy and robust.
Not only have we introduced countless new features and bug fixes, but we've built a more stable foundation for future development, allowing us to continue moving the project forward to meet the needs of the community.

## Migration

### .NET Lifecycle

Builds are no longer provided for .NET 6 or .NET 7.
This change aligns with Microsoft's [.NET support policies](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/platform/support/policy/dotnet-core) and lets us focus on providing the best support for newer editions.

Update your SDK to .NET 8 or .NET 9 to get the latest packages.

### MudBlazor Lifecycle

**v8:**
This is the current recommended version and all new features and development effort will be directed here.

**v7:**
We will continue to accept bugfixes from the community for v7 but no new features will be introduced and we won't accept any requests.

**v6:**
Support for v6 ended 01/2025 and no new patches will be released.

### Migrating from a Previous Version

The release of v7 addressed several long-standing needs for breaking changes and our goal for v8 is to build on that success while ensuring a smoother transition.

For help with migrating to a new version, please refer to the [v7.0.0 Migration Guide](https://github.com/MudBlazor/MudBlazor/issues/8447) or [v8.0.0 Migration Guide](https://github.com/MudBlazor/MudBlazor/issues/9953).
In addition we've created a [built-in analyzer](https://mudblazor.com/features/analyzers) that identifies parameters that have been removed or renamed.

## Looking Ahead

We are passionate about improving the library but can't make firm promises about release timelines or specific features as the MudBlazor team is made up of volunteers who contribute to the project in their personal time.

Our goal is to keep MudBlazor stable, performant, and evolving with thoughtful enhancements, but the pace of development depends on the availability of contributors.
We appreciate your support as we continue to work on keeping MudBlazor the premiere UI library for Blazor.
